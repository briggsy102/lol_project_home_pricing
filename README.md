Predict future housing prices 
# About
  * ** I will be using the Ames Housing Data set from Kaggle to create a model that is capable of predicting housing prices in a given market. 
# Initial Wriite-Up
  1. What is the question you hope to answer?
    * I hope to be able to accuratley predict with a high degree of certainty what the price of a home will be. 
  2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
    * I am using the Ames Housing Data set from Kaggle.  
  3. What do you know about the data you're using so far?
   * I know that there are 79 explanatory variables in my data set. I also know that this data is populated from housing sales in Ames, Iowa. 
  4. Why did you choose this topic?
    * I chose this project because in a past life I worked in the resdidential housing industry and know a great deal about residential homes. I am also in the market to be a first time home buyer and it would be interesting to create a prediction model for home sale prices.
